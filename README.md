# Personal-projects
Post Master Thesis projects to prepare for job openings, motivate myself to continue learning by reading new papers and potentially implementing them, shape coding skills particularly by implementing not thoroughly known concepts from scratch and applying to available data (e.g. Graph Neural Nets, Transformers).
Focus on finishing repositories followed by Kaggle competition / own project in medical domain.

## Timeline

* Finish Private AI course offered by udacity.com.
* Rerun not submitted parts of the DeepLearning Course
* Course to strengthen C++ skills (Leetcode)
* Start Codebase with Deep Learning concepts from scratch
* Application ideas: Temporal modelling using RNNs, Sound generation from raw data, Kaggle on medicine data
